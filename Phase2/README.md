&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When trying to find something to watch no one wants to spend 20 mins searching through 5 different websites each with contradicting ratings and information. At that point who wants to even watch anything anymore? The objective of this project is to put all that information into a single database so that users can easily find the movies that they want to watch. We wanted to simplify existing sites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes by having all the information in one place. We will have the ratings from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic side by side so that users can easily see the multiple ratings and decide if the movie is worth watching. On the front page of the database, there will be several movies displayed with basic information like the year the movie was released, the duration, and the synopsis. At the top of the page, there will be several buttons called genre, actor, director, awards, and rating. When a specific button is clicked it will lead to a separate page revealing the information the user requested along with the title of the movie. We also implemented a login page for both users and admins. Admins are able to insert new movies into the database as well as update already existing records. They can also delete records if need be. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things we would do differently if we were able to redo this project again. First, we would start much earlier than we did. We underestimated how hard it would be for us to learn php and build a proper working website resulting in us having to cut down on a lot of the stuff we wanted to implement. For example, we wanted to implement a search bar so that users could search through many different categories such as; genre, actors/actresses, awards, directors, ratings, movie titles in alphabetical order, etc. Furthermore, we wanted to implement a feature for users to leave their own reviews and audience rating. Some things that did go well was building the actual database. Creating the actual tables and queries was the easiest part for us, and coming up with the actual sample data. We’ve definitely learned that implementing a new language is hard and takes time to fully learn, and sometimes you have to simplify what you want to do in order to get things running first.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ways we could improve the project is by making the website look a little more appealing. It’s very boring to look at now. We could also easily refine it so that the home page isn’t cluttered with a bunch of buttons. The semester project could be improved for future classes by setting due dates and enforcing progress reports so that students aren’t overwhelmed at the end of the semester and can get help if needed. Additionally, maybe setting aside time to go over a little bit about web design, and giving more examples of php and html code. Overall, this project was difficult but it really tested our skills, and made us more confident in building databases.
